# Sequence_Alignment_Problem

**Project Description:**

**Implement the basic Dynamic Programming solution to the Sequence Alignment problem. Run
the test set provided and show your results.**

A. Algorithm Description:
Suppose we are given two strings X and Y, where X consists of the sequence of symbols
x1, x2 . . . xm and Y consists of the sequence of symbols y1, y2 . . . yn. Consider the sets {1,
2, . . . , m} and {1, 2, . . . , n} as representing the different positions in the strings X and Y,
and consider a matching of these sets; recall that a matching is a set of ordered pairs with
the property that each item occurs in at most one pair. We say that a matching M of these
two sets is an alignment if there are no “crossing” pairs: if (i, j), (i’ , j’ ) ∈ M and i < i’ ,
then j < j’ . Intuitively, an alignment gives a way of lining up the two strings, by telling
us which pairs of positions will be lined up with one another.
Our definition of similarity will be based on finding the optimal alignment between X
and Y, according to the following criteria. Suppose M is a given alignment between X
and Y:
1. First, there is a parameter δe > 0 that defines a gap penalty. For each position of X
or Y that is not matched in M — it is a gap — we incur a cost of δ.
2. Second, for each pair of letters p, q in our alphabet, there is a mismatch cost of αpq
for lining up p with q. Thus, for each (i, j) ∈ M, we pay the appropriate mismatch
cost αxiyj for lining up xi with yj. One generally assumes that αpp = 0 for each letter
p—there is no mismatch cost to line up a letter with another copy of
itself—although this will not be necessary in anything that follows.
3. The cost of M is the sum of its gap and mismatch costs, and we seek an alignment
of minimum cost.
B. Input string Generator:
The input to the program would be a text file, input.txt containing the following
information:
1. First base string
2. Next j lines would consist of indices corresponding the after which the
previous string to be added to the cumulative string
3. Second base string
4. Next k lines would consist of where the base string to be added to the
cumulative string
This information would help generate 2 strings from the original 2 base strings.
This file could be used as an input to your program and your program could use
the base strings and the rules to generate the actual strings. Also note that the
numbers j and k corresponds to the first and the second string respectively. Make
sure you validate the length of the first and the second string to be
2j*str1.length and 2k*str2.length. Please note that the base strings need
not have to be of equal length and similarly, j need not be equal to k.

C 110 0 118 48
G 48 118 0 110
T 94 48 110 0
D. Programming/Scripting Languages:
Following are the list of languages which could be used:
1. C
2. C++
3. Java
4. Python
5. Python3
E. Bounds:
Bounds on the length of the base strings and the values of m and n, along with the
zip file will be released on 17 November 2021, i.e. 3 weeks before the due date.
III. Goals
Following are the goals to achieve for your project
A. Your program should take input:
1. 2 strings that need to be aligned, should be generated from the string
generator mentioned above.
2. Gap penalty (δe).
3. Mismatch penalty (αpq).
B. Your solution should output output.txt file containing the following information at
the respective lines:
1. The first 50 elements and the last 50 elements of the actual alignment.
2. The time it took to complete the entire solution.
3. Memory required.
C. Implement the memory efficient version of this solution and repeat the tests in
Part B.
D. Plot the results of Part A and Part B:
1. Single plot of CPU time vs problem size for the two solutions.
2. Single plot of Memory usage vs problem size for the two solutions
